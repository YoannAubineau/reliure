To run the tests :

    1. Create ./reliure/tests/tmp directory and make sure it is writable.

    2. Serve ./reliure directory through a web server and access its 
    ./tests subdirectory. For example:

        $ ln -s ~/reliure /var/www/reliure
        $ links http://localhost/reliure/tests/

The tests are run with the ./tests/config.ini configuration file. Do not change
this file or you would break the tests.
