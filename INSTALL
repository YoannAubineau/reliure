INSTALLATION
============


With Apache
-----------

At the root directory of your web site:

    - Copy Reliure directory.
    
    - Add a .htaccess file that contains:

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ reliure/?url=$1 [QSA,L]

    - Create a template file, called site.php, that will hold the whole site

You can change names and locations to what better suit your environment, but be
sure to update the .htaccess and config.ini files accordingly.
